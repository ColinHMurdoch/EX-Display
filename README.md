# EX-Display

A project for multiple displays connected to EX-CommandStation via I2C

Raw proof of concept - developed on Mega2560 + mcufriend display shield, and using mcufriend_kbv library.

Connection is GND-GND and RX pin 19 on mega to serial tx pin on EX-CS.

Zero apologies for raw first effort here
